    rambling...slice the file from the opening and closing curly lines 
    if the line has length consider it:
        if the line has a ':' discard it and move on
        if the line contains a '(' then concatenate from the start of the line 
        until the first ';' if it not within an inline block.
        
        So I need a list of search zones for each slice that ignores the inline blocks
        
        class_xxx[(start, stop), (start, stop)...]
